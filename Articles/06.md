### Introduction

Go’s slice type provides a convenient and efficient means of working with sequences of typed data. Slices are analogous to arrays in other languages, but have some unusual properties. This article will look at what slices are and how they are used.

### Arrays

The slice type is an abstraction built on top of Go’s array type, and so to understand slices we must first understand arrays.

An array type definition specifies a length and an element type. For example, the type [4]int represents an array of four integers. An array’s size is fixed; its length is part of its type ([4]int and [5]int are distinct, incompatible types). Arrays can be indexed in the usual way, so the expression s[n] accesses the nth element, starting from zero.

```
var a [4]int
a[0] = 1
i := a[0]
// i == 1
```

Arrays do not need to be initialized explicitly; the zero value of an array is a ready-to-use array whose elements are themselves zeroed:
```
// a[2] == 0, the zero value of the int type
```
The in-memory representation of [4]int is just four integer values laid out sequentially:

Go’s arrays are values. An array variable denotes the entire array; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents. (To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then that’s a pointer to an array, not an array.) One way to think about arrays is as a sort of struct but with indexed rather than named fields: a fixed-size composite value.

An array literal can be specified like so:
```

b := [2]string{"Penn", "Teller"}
```

Or, you can have the compiler count the array elements for you:
```
b := [...]string{"Penn", "Teller"}
```

In both cases, the type of b is [2]string.

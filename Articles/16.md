### 5 basic for loop patterns

* https://yourbasic.org/golang/for-loop/


A for statement is used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

* Three-component loop
* While loop
* Infinite loop
* For-each range loop
* Exit a loop


### Three-component loop

This version of the Go for loop works just as in C or Java.

```
sum := 0
for i := 1; i < 5; i++ {
	sum += i
}
fmt.Println(sum) // 10 (1+2+3+4)
```

1. The init statement, i := 1, runs.
2. The condition, i < 5, is computed.
* If true, the loop body runs,
* otherwise the loop is done.
3. The post statement, i++, runs.
4. Back to step 2.

The scope of i is limited to the loop.

### While loop

If you skip the init and post statements, you get a while loop.
```
n := 1
for n < 5 {
	n *= 2
}
fmt.Println(n) // 8 (1*2*2*2)
```

1. The condition, n < 5, is computed.
* If true, the loop body runs,
* otherwise the loop is done.
2. Back to step 1.


### Infinite loop

If you skip the condition as well, you get an infinite loop.
```
sum := 0
for {
	sum++ // repeated forever
}
fmt.Println(sum) // never reached
```


### For-each range loop

Looping over elements in *slices, arrays, maps, channels or strings* is often better done with a range loop.
```
strings := []string{"hello", "world"}
for i, s := range strings {
	fmt.Println(i, s)
}

// 0 hello
// 1 world
```
